This project was completed following the course "React: The Complete Guide" on Udemy by instructor Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. I wrote the code following his example videos and all intellectual property belongs to him. I thoroughly recommend the course, which can be found at this URL: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

My version of the project has been deployed using Google Firebase, and can be viewed and interacted with using the link: https://react-my-burger-5cdc8.web.app/
